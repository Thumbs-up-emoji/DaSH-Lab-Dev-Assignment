    "Message": "What is BeeGFS?\n\nBeeGFS is a distributed file system that provides high performance, high availability, and scalability. It is designed to be used in a cluster of nodes, each of which has its own storage. The BeeGFS cluster is made up of a master node and one or more worker nodes. The master node is responsible for managing the cluster, including allocating storage and coordinating access to it. The worker nodes are responsible for storing and serving data, and they communicate with the master node through a network.",
