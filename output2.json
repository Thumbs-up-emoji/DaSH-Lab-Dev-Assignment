    "Message": "</h3>\n\nDocker is a \u201cContainer Engine\u201c. It abstracts away the hard disk, memory, CPU, network, and power management from the host running it to allow you to run\n\n containers. It is similar to a program (.exe/.app) in Windows or Linux, but it does not need to be run on the same software platform as the host. To run Docker, you only need a <i>docker run</i> command. The cool part is that you can run a container without a host or",

    "Message": "BeeGFS was created by Nigel Morris who was frustrated by the cost competitiveness of Software Defined Storage. The idea was to create an open source system to make the underlying storage infrastructure highly resource efficient. The idea was no different to where we are developing DataOffice now. By performing a lot of the storage sub-systems virtualisation and RAM server based, this created a very compressed data centre, with a very high processing and storage load to maintain the underlying storage mechanics.\n\nTherefore, each virtual CPU",
